/*
 * Debug console on UART1: routes the C library's stdout and stderr (printf,
 * puts, putchar) to the UART1 driver. UART1 is the link to the ESP32, which
 * bridges it to a serial terminal. Until the ESP speaks SML the text goes out
 * raw; once it does (esp/esp_link.h), the link installs a sink and the text
 * travels inside SML-STAT-DEBUG frames, between the binary messages.
 *
 * XC16's libc sends all stream output through write(); console.c provides
 * that function in the .libc.write section, which replaces the library's
 * default (the simulator's UART). Nothing else is needed for the existing
 * printf calls to work.
 *
 * Output policy: write() blocks until every byte is queued. The 1 KB TX ring
 * absorbs the per-second status burst, so in normal running it never waits.
 * If it does wait, it moves bytes into the UART itself (uart1_tx_poll), so it
 * cannot deadlock when called with the UART interrupt held off, for example
 * inside a __builtin_disi() window. Interrupts are never disabled by it, so
 * the epoch timing runs undisturbed while it waits.
 *
 * Foreground use only: do not printf from an interrupt handler.
