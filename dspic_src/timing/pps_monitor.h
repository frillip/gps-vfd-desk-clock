/*
 * Interrupt-on-change watch of both PPS inputs: the GNSS PPS (RA8) and the
 * ESP PPS (RB15).
 *
 * Only one of them can be captured by IC1/IC2 at a time (pps_capture.h);
 * the other would otherwise go unseen. Each rising edge on either pin is
 * timestamped here from the capture timebase, numbered, and given its
 * epoch_timer_ms() time. That is coarse evidence: the timestamp carries the
 * interrupt latency (a microsecond or so, more if a higher-priority
 * interrupt or a DISI section is running), but it shows that a source's
 * pulses are arriving and roughly where, which is enough to qualify it and
 * to label its edges. Steering still needs the capture.
 *
 * The edge numbers here are the ones the sources label with UTC: gnss/
 * associates navigation epochs with GNSS edges, sync/source_ntp.c
 * associates TIME-NTP messages with ESP edges. They count every edge seen,
 * whether or not the pin is also routed to the capture, so routing never
 * disturbs labelling. A captured edge is paired with its number by
 * timestamp (sync/source_edge.c).

 * Interrupt latency subtracted from a watched edge's timestamp to estimate
 * the edge itself. Measured on V2 (2026-10-20, IOC minus capture): 33 ticks
 * (sd 1) for the ESP PPS on the NTP clock. An edge that coincides with the
 * epoch waits for the epoch interrupts (priority 4) as well: the GNSS PPS on
 * a GNSS-locked clock was 196 ticks (sd 0.6). So a watched source within a
 * few microseconds of the epoch reads ~4 us late.
