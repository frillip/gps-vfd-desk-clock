/*
 * Cooperative scheduler: decides which blocks of the main loop run on this
 * pass. The task list itself stays in main(), where it can be read top to
 * bottom:
 *
 *   static SchedulerTask every_10ms = SCHEDULER_EVERY("10 ms", 10);
 *   static SchedulerTask display_load = SCHEDULER_AT_SLOT("display load", 500);
 *
 *   while (1)
 *   {
 *       scheduler_pass();
 *       if (scheduler_due(&every_10ms))
 *       {
 *           poll_gnss();
 *       }
 *       if (scheduler_due(&display_load))
 *       {
 *           display_service();
 *       }
 *   }
 *
 * Time comes from the epoch timer (epoch_timer.h), not a timer of its own:
 * milliseconds that are exactly 1000 per epoch while tracking, and slots
 * counted from each epoch. So a periodic task keeps its phase against the
 * second, and a slot task runs at a fixed point in every second (once the
 * epoch pulse has ended, say) however long the epoch.
 *
 *   SCHEDULER_EVERY(name, period_ms)  every period_ms (at least 1). Due times are fixed
 *       on the timeline: a late run does not delay the next, and periods
 *       missed outright are skipped (and counted), never run back to back.
 *   SCHEDULER_AT_SLOT(name, slot)  once per epoch, at or after that slot.
 *       Epochs that end before it runs are counted as missed.
 *   SCHEDULER_SECTION(name)  work started by something else (the epoch
 *       snapshot, say): scheduler_section() marks its start, for timing only.
 *
 * Each task is timed from the moment it starts (scheduler_due() returning
 * true, or scheduler_section()) to the next call into the scheduler, so a
 * block of the main loop timed this way needs no end marker. Sections can
 * follow each other to time the parts of one block.
 *
 * Every task is listed by scheduler_print() with its runs, skipped or
 * missed periods, its worst lateness, its longest run and its share of the
 * time, and the longest pass of the main loop: the measure of whether
 * something is blocking it. Times are whole milliseconds: runs shorter than
 * 1 ms count only as they cross a millisecond boundary.
