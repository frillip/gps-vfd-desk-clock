/*
 * Program flash, for the settings store (settings/store.h): erasing a page,
 * writing two instruction words at a time, reading them back.
 *
 * Only the store's own pages can be written. They are reserved here, at a
 * fixed address apart from the application:
 *
 *   0x000000 - 0x0297FF  application (and any bootloader or update slots)
 *   0x029800 - 0x02A7FF  the store: FLASH_STORE_PAGES erase pages
 *   0x02A800 - 0x02AFFF  the last page, with the configuration words
 *                        (0x02AFEC on): never erased by the application
 *
 * The reservation (flash.c) is placed with address() and marked noload, so
 * the linker puts nothing else there and the application's hex holds
 * nothing for it: programming a new application, by the debugger with its
 * "preserve program memory" range set (nbproject) or by a bootloader that
 * skips the range, leaves the settings as they were.
 *
 * Each instruction word holds 16 bits of data in its low word, as constant
 * data does; the upper byte is written 0xFF. An erase page is 1024
 * instructions (0x800 program addresses, 2 KB of data); a double word is
 * two instructions (4 program addresses, 4 bytes of data). A double word
 * can be written once between erases: writing it again is not allowed.
 *
 * Erasing and writing stop the CPU until the operation is done: the flash
 * cannot be read while it is busy. Interrupts are held off for the whole of
 * it, about 20-30 ms for a page erase and some 50 us for a double word, and
 * the resume hook (flash_set_resume_hook) runs before they are let back on,
 * to put right whatever counts interrupts (epoch_timer_resume). Hardware
 * keeps running throughout: the timers, the captures and the epoch output
 * are not disturbed, but UART bytes arriving while the FIFOs are full are
 * lost. Callers choose a quiet moment (settings/settings.h).
