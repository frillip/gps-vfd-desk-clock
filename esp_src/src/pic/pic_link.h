/*
 * The link to the dsPIC on UART2, in SML (common/SML_PROTOCOL.md).
 *
 * Receiving: every byte goes through the SML parser. Bytes that are not part
 * of a frame are the PIC's raw console text (a PIC in TEXT mode, e.g. just
 * after its reset) and go to the console, printable characters only. Frames:
 *   TIME-AUTH      paired with the PIC epoch edge captured on GPIO27
 *   TIME-PIC/CTRL/MEAS/GNSS, STAT-UI and any other PIC state: held, with age
 *   STAT-DEBUG     the PIC's console text, to the console
 *   CMD-USER       ESP commands from the PIC (codes 0x8000 up): run by the
 *                  handler from pic_link_set_command_handler(), answered
 *   STAT-SETTINGS  held, as the base for changing the PIC's settings
 *   CMD-RESPONSE   answers to pic_link_request() and to settings writes,
 *                  printed where they were asked
 *
 * The PIC moves to SML mode on the first valid frame it receives, so the
 * ESP sends CMD-USER SHOW (everything) at start, and its periodic frames (STAT-NET every
 * 10 s) bring a PIC back to SML mode after the PIC resets.
 *
 * TIME-AUTH pairing: the label arrives a few ms after the edge it labels, so
 * it is paired with the latest captured edge if that is under 900 ms old.
 * Bytes read after the loop was held up (an HTTP request) may be older than
 * that suggests, so frames from such a backlog are not paired.
