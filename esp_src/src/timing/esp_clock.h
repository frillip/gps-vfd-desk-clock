/*
 * The ESP's UTC: a model of UTC against the local microsecond timer
 * (esp_timer, the APB crystal), disciplined by NTP samples. Portable, no
 * Arduino dependency, so it can be driven by a host simulation.
 *
 *   utc(t) = anchor_utc + (t - anchor) x (1 + frequency) + slew(t)
 *
 * Each sample is the best exchange of an NTP poll: the offset UTC - local at
 * the local midpoint of the exchange, and its round trip. The sample is
 * judged against the model at its own time, but every change takes effect
 * from the moment of the update, never retroactively: an update moves the
 * clock (and so the ESP PPS edge) only as fast as the slew allows.
 *
 *   - The first sample, or one more than ESP_CLOCK_STEP_US from the model,
 *     steps the clock.
 *   - A correction up to ESP_CLOCK_GENTLE_US is slewed in over the time
 *     constant the caller gives (about two poll intervals), but never faster
 *     than SML_NTP_GENTLE_SLEW_PPM: slow enough for the PIC to follow
 *     without stepping, and the next sample replaces what is left of it, so
 *     each sample's noise is only half applied.
 *   - A larger one is slewed in at ESP_CLOCK_FAST_SLEW_PPM, reported as
 *     correcting (SML_NTP_CORRECTING) until done: the PIC cannot follow it
 *     in any case, so it might as well be quick.
 *   - Frequency: a least-squares line through the raw offsets of the latest
 *     ESP_CLOCK_WINDOW samples, those with a round trip well above the
 *     window's best left out (their asymmetry is unknown). Needs
 *     ESP_CLOCK_FREQUENCY_MIN_US of span; two samples give a first estimate.
 *
 * The uncertainty is a +/- bound in the sense of SML: half the round trip,
 * the server's root delay / 2 and root dispersion, the part of the error not
 * yet slewed in, and a drift allowance since the sample (50 ppm until the
 * frequency is known, 5 ppm after one estimate, 2 ppm after more).
