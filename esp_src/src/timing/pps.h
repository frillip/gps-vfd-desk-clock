/*
 * Hardware edges, all timed in local microseconds (esp_timer):
 *
 *   ESP PPS out  GPIO5, a 100 ms pulse whose rising edge is the ESP's UTC
 *                second, made by a 1 MHz gptimer alarm. The timer and
 *                esp_timer count the same crystal, so a local time maps to a
 *                timer count by a fixed offset measured at start.
 *   PIC epoch    GPIO27 rising edge, timestamped in its interrupt.
 *   GNSS PPS     GPIO18 rising edge (only with the solder jumpers fitted).
 *
 * The output runs itself: at each falling edge the interrupt arms the next
 * rising edge, at the time the loop planned with pps_output_plan() if it did,
 * or else one second on, corrected for frequency. So a busy loop (an HTTP
 * request, an OTA check) does not lose a second; it only delays corrections.
 * The edge time recorded is esp_timer read in the interrupt just after the
 * pin is set, so interrupt latency is measured, not hidden.
